<h1 align="center">textractor-js üöúüï∏Ô∏è</h1>

A simple text extractor for various files compiled to WebAssembly. This is intended to be used directly in the browser to quickly and easily extract text from various file formats.

If you are looking for the main `textractor` project, you can find it [here](https://github.com/nleroy917/textractor).

## Installation
You can use the `textractor` package in your own project by installing from npm:
```bash
npm install textractor-js
```

This is very much a work in progress. I am working to prioritize adding PPTX and XLSX support, as well as improving the text extraction for PDFs.

## Supported formats
- [X] Text (txt)
- [X] PDF
- [X] Word (docx)
- [ ] Excel (xlsx)
- [ ] PowerPoint (pptx)
- [ ] Images (png, jpg, etc)
